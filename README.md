# todo-app

This is the start of my To-Do app.

All my knowledge put into this app is thanks to the enterprise Rocketseat, they're great.

Also, some years of fiddling with FreeCodeCamp tutorials helped. Thanks also to Mom (haha) that didn't let me give up such a simple thing as a todo-app. A bare-bones one, of all of the things.
